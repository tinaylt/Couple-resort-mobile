This unique indulgence is not to be missed!

            <p>We have 6 Spa Treatment Rooms.
                <br><br>
                When you arrive please have on loose comfortable clothing if you are having Facials. Body Molding and Body wraps you will just have on your robe and an undergarment, and can change in the Treatment Room.<br><br>
                Appointments can be held between 9:00 am to 9:00 pm. Appointments can be made for up to 2 people at a time, depending on accommodation size and availability of the Spa Practitioners.
                <br><br>
                100 Percent of the full treatment price will be charged to your account for cancellations and no-shows made less than twelve (12) hours prior to the appointment time.
                <br><br>
                For Success in an Algonquin Spa Experience in Rejuvenation please pre-book your appointment. Please note that we cannot guarantee that even with a pre-booking that you will receive your appointment due to illness or extenuating circumstances. However, we will inform you as soon as we are aware and work diligently to work with you to find a possible alternative to your booking.
                <br><br>
                * Treatments will automatically be charged to your account, add 13% HST. Please observe a NO EXTRA TIPPING policy, as we wish that you would rather take another appointment, do another activity, have another wine or stay another night…..any of these will help all, far more than a single extra tip.</p>

            <h3>Unforeseen Circumstances</h3>

            <div>It is very rare that one of our Spa Professionals gets sick or has a family emergency and we understand it is extremely disappointing to not have the treatment you requested. Staff will make every effort in finding an alternative time in the day or during your stay with another therapist, sometimes involving a slightly different Treatment. We appreciate our guests for being so patient during these unforeseen circumstances. Currently if there is a cancellation and you cannot be accommodated, there will be no Spa charge to your room.<br>
            A Free Voucher for a 1 hour (Not RMT) Spa Treatment will now be provided for your next getaway at the Couples Resort.<br>
            The Policy change allows us not only to make sure there is no out of pocket expense (the cost of the treatment) but that we will also compensate you beyond what the Couples Resort could not provide you.<br><br>
            Thank You & Enjoy in Our Pleasure,<br>
            <span>John Sorensen, President.</span>
